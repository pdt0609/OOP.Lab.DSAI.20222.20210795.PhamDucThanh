For example, in the Media class, you must cast the Object obj to a Media, and then check the equality of the two objectsâ€™ attributes as the 
above requirements (i.e. title for Media; title and length for Track). If the passing object is 
not an instance of Media, what happens?
+,System error


Which classes are aggregates of other classes? Checking all constructors of whole classes if they 
initialize for their parts?
+, Class CompactDisc is the aggregation of the Track class


- What class should implement the Comparable interface?
+, class MediaComparatorByCostTitle  and class MediaComparatorByTitleCost

- In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method be to reflect the ordering that we 
want?
+,just compare cost or title.

- Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this 
Comparable interface approach
+,Yes, we can
